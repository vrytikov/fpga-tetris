A few design notes:
1.This project is based on Basys-2 fpga board with an external crystal 25.175 MHz.
2.openPICIDE is a tool to compile firmware. It has a bit different than the default picoblaze instruction mnemonics.
Keep that in mind if you try to compile the source code using the vanilla compiler.
